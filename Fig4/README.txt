Numerical phase field simulation to derive the denoise process compared with experiments is conducted by codes 'phase_field.py'

The program can be run with only basic python packages (included in common base environment like anaconda, no special installation needed)

Run the program will read the file 'energy_profile.txt' that includes the phase energy on the transition pathway derived by the DFT calculations. It also reads the 'initial_state.json' that includes the initial phase field read from experimental data. The program directly output figures of simulation results in Fig. 4.
