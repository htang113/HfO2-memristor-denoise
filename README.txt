Numerical simulation of Coulomb blockade of island-like incomplete channel by quantum transport is conducted by codes 'Island.py'

The program can be run with only basic python packages (included in common base environment like anaconda, no special installation needed)

Run the program will output data 'wave_function.txt', which directly gives the curves in Fig. 3d.
